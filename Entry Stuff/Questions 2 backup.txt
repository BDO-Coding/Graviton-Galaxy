If you could develop your game further, what would you do? (300 words)
I would change the planet scenes so that they scrolled along a circular world. Improve the resolution of all textures. Add more armour, weapons and monsters (more variety). But mainly have multiple objectives so that the game didn't just end when you got 5 gravitons. Also, the game would be much better with progressive difficulty so that it got harder as you progressed.
